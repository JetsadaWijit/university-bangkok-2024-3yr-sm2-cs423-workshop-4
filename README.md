[`Wokwi Project`](https://wokwi.com/projects/390598738441084929)

This is an Arduino project example made on [`Wokwi`](https://wokwi.com) to integrate with [`SenseIoT`](https://sensesiot.net), designed for learning purposes

## How does it work?

I used a simulator in [`Wokwi`](https://wokwi.com) to read humidity and send information to [`SenseIoT`](https://sensesiot.net) for display on modules
